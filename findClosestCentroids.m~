function idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids)
%FINDCLOSESTCENTROIDS computes the centroid memberships for every example
%   idx = FINDCLOSESTCENTROIDS (X, centroids) returns the closest centroids
%   in idx for a dataset X where each row is a single example. idx = m x 1 
%   vector of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K])
%

% Set K
K = size(centroids, 1);

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
idx = zeros(size(X,1), 1);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Go over every example, find its closest centroid, and store
%               the index inside idx at the appropriate location.
%               Concretely, idx(i) should contain the index of the centroid
%               closest to example i. Hence, it should be a value in the 
%               range 1..K
%
%
%
for i = 1:size(X)
    minindex = 1;
    mindist = distbwvectors(X(i)', X(1)');
    for j = 1:K %allowing for 1 in case that there is only one cluster lol
        newind = centroid(j);
        newdist = distbwvectors(X(i)', X(newind)');
        if newdist < mindist
            mindist = newdist
            minindex = j
        end
    end
    idx(i) = minindex;
end
